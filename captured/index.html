      No steps added. Take a screen shot and Captured will upload the image to the <a href="http://imgur.com">imgur.com</a> automatically, and copy the link to your clipboard.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is to take a common task and stream line it to the absolute minimum possible. Allowing you to work faster, and spend more time thinking about your projects and not how you are going to share a picture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Captured is not affiliated with <a href="http://imgur.com">imgur.com</a> in any way, but loves the wonderful service they provide.
