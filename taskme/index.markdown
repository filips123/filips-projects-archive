Last thing you need is another task list that you will you don't look at. 
Task Me puts your quick reminders, todos, and tasks directly to where you will see them -- your
email inbox.

Removes any repetitive steps for sending yourself simple email notes, with a simple interface and easy setup. 

Both Gmail and MobileMe have easy setup built right in, but Task Me can also be configured manually to be used with most SMTP servers.
